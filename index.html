          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p><a href='https://schoolstatefinance.org/'>The School + State Finance Project</a> is a non-profit organization whose stated aim is to work with Connecticut policymakers to eliminate disparities in funding education funding across the state. This work includes addressing and researching how funding varies across districts based on certain student enrollment demographics, such as being low-income, a multilingual learner, or having a disability. But the project’s main focus, as well as that of this data story, is school funding gaps along racial/ethnic lines; as the project has found, decades of exclusionary policies and laws have left Connecticut segregated, with the state’s towns that have the highest percentages of Black, Indigenous, Latino, and any other person of color (BILPOC) residents frequently having some of the lowest median household incomes in the state <a href='https://schoolstatefinance.org/issues/segregated-connecticut'>(School and State Finance Project)</a>. </p>

          <p>Our work here continues from this question of how state spending varies across Connecticut school districts, particularly by using spending per enrolled student as a metric. While much of the groundwork regarding this question has been laid by the School + State Finance Project, we hope to offer a more regional analysis by studying similar data in the neighboring state of Massachusetts. By expanding our scope of analysis to southern New England in this way, we found patterns between these two states that might pave the way for researching new potential remedies. Our hope for this work is to raise awareness of financial inequality that impacts a broader swath of American youths.</p>

          <h2>Conneticut Data</h2>
        
          <p>When considering both Connecticut and Massachusetts, it is important first to look at the states separately. Beginning with Connecticut, we started with general data about both BILPOC populations across the state as well as median household income, a metric that we used as a measure of each Connecticut town’s comparative wealth.</p>

          <iframe title="Percent BILPOC Population and Median Household Income in Connecticut, 2023" aria-label="Choropleth map" id="datawrapper-chart-nzrhy" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nzrhy/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="615" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>


          <p><a href='https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nzrhy/3/'>(Figure 1)</a>: A map of Connecticut which allows you to switch between seeing each town’s BILPOC population and median household income.
 </p>



          <p>The two maps reveal a striking pattern: the areas in the state that have the highest percentages of BILPOC populations also frequently have the lowest median household incomes. The most obvious places where this pattern is evident is in the center of the state with Hartford; with one of the highest BILPOC populations in Connecticut, it also has the lowest median household income at $45,000. Conversely, Darien, in the southeast corner of the state, has a relatively low BILPOC population at 15.7%, while having a median household income of over $250,000. Generally, the darkest areas on the BILPOC population map (indicating a high population) are the lightest on the income map (indicating a low income).

This map serves as a good guiding post as to specific school districts we can look at in the state. The district data we found pertained to student enrollment in the state’s school districts by race, as well as a per pupil expenditure (PPE) amount, which is a rough calculation of how much a district spends per enrolled student. </p>

<p> The chart’s trend line reveals that there is a slightly positive relationship between per pupil expenditure and BILPOC student percentage. This indicates that the more BILPOC students that a district has enrolled the more money they put into the district. This is the opposite of what we see in Connecticut. The data shows that even if the change is slight in both directions, overall Massachusetts is spending more in districts with higher BILPOC student percentages than Conneticut for the same percentage of BILPOC students. 


Looking at the map of Massachusetts, meanwhile, will help you see the BILPOC population across the state with a visual representation of the diversity in the state. The chart will allow you to see the percentage of racial diversity by enrollment in each district.

          <p>Figure 4: we are changing it to a map I swear!!! dont be mad at us!!!</p>

         <p>The map above reveals that some of the towns in Massachusetts with the highest median household income are in the eastern half of the state, mainly surrounding Boston. The table of MA school districts, on the other hand, reveals that these wealthy suburbs routinely have lower percentages of BILPOC students enrolled in their local districts. Take Tewksbury; the map reveals it to have a median household income of $234.6K, while the table shows that its town school district has a BILPOC enrollment of only 22.2%. Similarly, Wilmington, which has one of the highest median incomes at $250k, has a BILPOC enrollment of 19.7%. This is further expressed by the scatterplot, showcasing the 

Some of MA’s school districts are regional, and thus could not be placed precisely on the state map. Others are charter school districts, routinely have very high percentages of BILPOC students. An interesting example can be seen with the Foxborough Regional Charter district, which has a rather high BILPOC enrollment of 85.3%. But the town’s school district has only 27.3% BILPOC enrollment, and its median household income is also one of the highest visible on the map at $250k. This observation calls into question whether or not these regional/charter districts, which seem predominantly BILPOC, have similar levels of school funding as predominantly white ones, even when they’re within the same region.
